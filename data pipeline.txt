Detailed Plan for Using the Customer Short List for Analytics Update
1. Track When You Last Updated Analytics
Keep a record of the last time you ran the analytics update job (for example, yesterday at 2am).

2. Identify Relevant Customers
A. Customers with CRM Changes:

Review the CRM system for customers whose information (name, age, location, etc.) was changed or updated after your last analytics job.

B. Customers with New Transactions:

Check transaction logs for customers who had new interactions (calls, chats, etc.) after the last run.

3. Build the Short List
Combine the list of customers from CRM changes and the list from new transactions.

Make sure each customer appears only once in this combined list (remove duplicates).

4. For Each Customer in the Short List:
a) Get the Latest Customer Profile
Fetch the most recent customer details from CRM (in case of any profile updates).

b) Get Transaction Data
Gather all the customer’s new transactions since the last run (or, if needed for accurate metrics, fetch all their transactions for a specific period like the current month).

c) Calculate Metrics
AHT (Average Handle Time):

If you keep running totals, add up the new durations and update the total and count; otherwise, recalculate from scratch for the period you care about.

FCR (First Call Resolution):

Determine, among their new issues, which were resolved in the first interaction without repeats.

Escalation Rate:

Count how many of the new interactions needed to be escalated to a supervisor or higher tier.

d) Update Analytics Table
Write (insert or update) the analytics data for this customer into your Analytics Table.

e) Log Results (Optional but Recommended)
Keep track of which customers were processed, whether updates were successful, and any errors encountered (this is helpful for audits and troubleshooting).

5. After All Customers Are Processed
Update your “last run time” marker to the time this job finished.

This ensures next time, you only pick up new or changed data.

6. (Optional Enhancements for Large Scale)
Parallel Processing:

If your short list is large, you can split the list and process customers in parallel (using multiple threads or machines).

Error Handling:

If there’s a failure on one customer, record it but allow the rest to continue.

Monitoring and Alerts:

Set up alerts if the job fails or takes too long.

Summary Table of Steps
Step	What You Do	Why
1	Track last update time	For incremental processing
2	Find changed customers (CRM + transactions)	To target only customers with changes
3	Build unique short list	Avoid double work
4	For each customer: get data, calculate, update	Perform focused analytics update
5	Update last run time	Prep for next cycle
6	(Optional) parallel, monitor, error-handle	Robustness and scalability

This plan ensures you always work only on customers with actual new activity or changes, making your analytics scalable and up-to-date without unnecessary workload.
